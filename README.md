Certainly! Here's the updated README text with explanations of the script:

## Automated Daily Tasks for Different Linux Distributions

This script automates daily tasks for different Linux distributions (CentOS, Ubuntu, Alpine) based on the detected distribution.

### Prerequisites

- **Supported Linux Distributions**: The script is designed to work on specific Linux distributions, including CentOS, Ubuntu, and Alpine. Make sure you are running one of these distributions for the script to function correctly.

- **Internet Connectivity**: The script performs package updates and installations using package managers, which require internet connectivity to download and install packages.

- **Permissions for Scripts**: Ensure that the script files (`daily_tasks.sh`, `centos_daily_job.sh`, `ubuntu_daily_job.sh`, `alpine_daily_job.sh`, etc.) have execute permissions (`chmod +x`) to allow them to be executed.

### Explanation of the Script

- The script is written in Bash and contains three main functions: `centos_tasks`, `ubuntu_tasks`, and `alpine_tasks`. Each function represents the tasks specific to CentOS, Ubuntu, and Alpine distributions, respectively.

- The script uses conditional statements (`if` and `elif`) to determine the Linux distribution running on the system. It does this by checking the presence of specific files (`/etc/redhat-release`, `/etc/lsb-release`, and `/etc/alpine-release`) that are unique to each distribution. Based on the detected distribution, the script calls the corresponding function to execute the appropriate tasks.

- For CentOS distributions, the script performs tasks such as updating packages, installing httpd and certbot, stopping and starting the http server as the "apache" user, and verifying SSL certificate validity.

- For Ubuntu distributions, the script performs tasks such as updating packages, installing MariaDB, enabling MariaDB, and changing the root password of MariaDB. The script uses the `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable to securely set the root password.

- For Alpine distributions, the script performs tasks such as updating packages, installing Docker, and bringing up a "Hello World" container.

- The script includes comments that provide descriptive explanations for each task to help users understand what actions the script will perform.

### Usage

1. Copy the script `daily_tasks.sh` to your Linux server.

2. Set execution permissions for the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x daily_tasks.sh
   ```

3. Create an environment variable to store the database password securely.
   For example, in Linux, execute the following command to set the `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable (replace `'your_database_password'` with your desired root password):
   ```bash
   export DB_PASSWORD="your_database_password"
   ```

4. If using Ubuntu, ensure that the `mysql-client` package is installed on the system. This package provides the `mysql` command-line client required for the MariaDB task.

5. Before executing the script, review the tasks to understand what actions the script will perform on your system. Always use caution when executing scripts, especially those that have the potential to make changes to your system.

6. To run the script and perform the daily tasks for the detected distribution, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, execute the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   ./daily_tasks.sh
   ```

   The script will automatically determine the distribution based on the presence of specific files on the system and execute the appropriate tasks accordingly.

7. If you want to schedule the script to run at 6 AM daily, set up a cron job on your system. Open the crontab configuration using the following command:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

8. Add the following line to the crontab to schedule the script to run at 6 AM every day:
   ```bash
   0 6 * * * /path/to/daily_tasks.sh
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/daily_tasks.sh` with the actual path to the script on your system.

9. Save the crontab configuration, and the script will now run automatically at 6 AM daily.

### Important Note

- Ensure you have set the `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable before running the script for Ubuntu. This variable will be used to set the root password for MariaDB.

- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script and run the tasks as needed.

- For security reasons, avoid sharing or exposing the script with sensitive information to unauthorized users.

- Always review and understand the tasks before executing any script on your system.

- Consider testing the script in a controlled environment before deploying it to production to ensure it behaves as expected on your specific setup.

- If you encounter any issues or errors while running the script, double-check the prerequisites and ensure that the script is compatible with your Linux distribution.

Enjoy automating your daily tasks with this script for different Linux distributions!

With these additions, the README text now provides an overview of the script's functionality, explains the tasks for each distribution, and offers usage instructions to help users run and schedule the script effectively.
